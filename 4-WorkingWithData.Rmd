## Logical operators
There are also a number of logical operators involved in R. You likely are familiar with these concepts through greater than and less than inequalities! Here is a table that spells out many of the operations, how it would be coded in R, and the output R gives. Notice the logic results in "TRUE" or "FALSE". This concept might be familiar if you have used Excel.

| Operator | Summary               | Example               | Result |
|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| `x < y`  | `x` less than `y`                | `3 < 42`               | `r 3 < 42`               |
| `x > y`  | `x` greater than `y`             | `3 > 42`               | `r 3 > 42`               |
| `x <= y` | `x` less than or equal to `y`    | `3 <= 42`              | `r 3 <= 42`              |
| `x >= y` | `x` greater than or equal to `y` | `3 >= 42`              | `r 3 >= 42`              |
| `x == y` | `x`equal to `y`                  | `3 == 42`              | `r 3 == 42`              |
| `x != y` | `x` not equal to `y`             | `3 != 42`              | `r 3 != 42`              |
| `!x`     | not `x`                          | `!(3 > 42)`            | `r !(3 > 42)`            |
| `x | y`  | `x` or `y`                       | `(3 > 42) | TRUE`      | `r (3 > 42) | TRUE`      |
| `x & y`  | `x` and `y`                      | `(3 < 4) & ( 42 > 13)` | `r (3 < 4) & ( 42 > 13)` |
