## Basic operations
Here, we will be going over the very basic operations involved in coding. Most of coding relates to mathematics and logic! For example, below is a table that features basic math (addition, subject, etc.), how it is written in R (pay attention to the symbols used), and its result.

| Math          | `R` code| Result    |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| $8 + 4$       | `8 + 4` | `r 8 + 4` |
| $8 - 4$       | `8 - 4` | `r 8 - 4` |
| $8 \cdot4$    | `8 * 4` | `r 8 * 4` |
| $8 / 4$       | `8 / 4` | `r 8 / 4` |
| $8^4$         | `8 ^ 4` | `r 8 ^ 4` |

## Logical operators
| Operator | Summary               | Example               | Result |
|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| `x < y`  | `x` less than `y`                | `3 < 42`               | `r 3 < 42`               |
| `x > y`  | `x` greater than `y`             | `3 > 42`               | `r 3 > 42`               |
| `x <= y` | `x` less than or equal to `y`    | `3 <= 42`              | `r 3 <= 42`              |
| `x >= y` | `x` greater than or equal to `y` | `3 >= 42`              | `r 3 >= 42`              |
| `x == y` | `x`equal to `y`                  | `3 == 42`              | `r 3 == 42`              |
| `x != y` | `x` not equal to `y`             | `3 != 42`              | `r 3 != 42`              |
| `!x`     | not `x`                          | `!(3 > 42)`            | `r !(3 > 42)`            |
| `x | y`  | `x` or `y`                       | `(3 > 42) | TRUE`      | `r (3 > 42) | TRUE`      |
| `x & y`  | `x` and `y`                      | `(3 < 4) & ( 42 > 13)` | `r (3 < 4) & ( 42 > 13)` |


## Basic data types
There are 5 data types to know of:

- Character
- Numeric
- Integer
- Logical
- Complex

## Data structures
| Dimension | **Homogeneous** | **Heterogeneous** |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1         | Vector          | List              |
| 2         | Matrix          | Data Frame        |
| 3+        | Array           |                   |
