Most of coding relates to mathematics and logic! For example, below is a table that features basic math (addition, subject, etc.), how it is written in R (pay attention to the symbols used), and its result. Math R code Result \\(8 + 4\\) 8 + 4 12 \\(8 - 4\\) 8 - 4 4 \\(8 \\cdot4\\) 8 * 4 32 \\(8 / 4\\) 8 / 4 2 \\(8^4\\) 8 ^ 4 4096 3.2 Logical operators Operator Summary Example Result x &lt; y x less than y 3 &lt; 42 TRUE x &gt; y x greater than y 3 &gt; 42 FALSE x &lt;= y x less than or equal to y 3 &lt;= 42 TRUE x &gt;= y x greater than or equal to y 3 &gt;= 42 FALSE x == y xequal to y 3 == 42 FALSE x != y x not equal to y 3 != 42 TRUE !x not x !(3 &gt; 42) TRUE x | y x or y (3 &gt; 42) | TRUE TRUE x &amp; y x and y (3 &lt; 4) &amp; ( 42 &gt; 13) TRUE 3.3 Basic data types There are 5 data types to know of: Character Numeric Integer Logical Complex 3.4 Data structures Dimension Homogeneous Heterogeneous 1 Vector List 2 Matrix Data Frame 3+ Array 3.5 Variable assignment "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
