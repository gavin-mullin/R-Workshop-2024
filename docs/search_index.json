Gavin and Yanzi are very excited to work with you all! Our goal is to teach you the basics and possibilities of RStudio, along with introducing you to resources and tools that will help you independently work with RStudio. 1.2 Important note Before we begin, we want to emphasize that learning R/RStudio (or any type of programming) is challenging and likely a novel topic for most of you. Therefore, it is completely normal to feel confused or overwhelmed at times. Please do not worry if you do not understand everything perfectly right away! Know that you will NOT be judged for asking questions or needing more time to learn certain topics. We are here to help! 1.3 Acknowledgements David Dalpiaz "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What are R and RStudio? 2.2 Installing R and RStudio 2.3 The RStudio interface", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What are R and RStudio? First, it should be noted that R and RStudio are actually two different things: R is a programming language RStudio is an application that provides a more user-friendly environment to use R But besides that, what is the importance of R? R is a powerful tool for statistics and data analysis, and is very attractive for both research and data science broadly. On top of this, it is accessible; R and RStudio are both free and open-source. This accessibility has resulted in a large community where learning and getting help is fast and easy. 2.2 Installing R and RStudio You will have to download both R and RStudio for this workshop (again, these are both FREE!!). Here is a link to the general website (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), but I will also embed specific links below for a direct download: For Window users R for Windows RStudio for Windows For Mac users R for Mac RStudio for Mac 2.3 The RStudio interface Please watch this short 6 minute video to get started with RStudio. This video does include some simple coding as an example, but don’t worry if you don’t understand that for now. Focus just on the interface for the time being. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIrsOBy5k58&amp;t=242s Feel free to change the theme of your RStudio window (like changing it to dark mode) before we go further! You can access this by Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; Apperance, and then selecting a new theme. Highlight them all and see what you like, or feel free to change your font size or type. "],["getting-started.html", "Chapter 3 Getting started 3.1 Script vs. notebook vs. markdown? 3.2 Basic operations", " Chapter 3 Getting started 3.1 Script vs. notebook vs. markdown? There are essentially three different file types to note when it comes to creating R code: script, notebook, and markdown. To put it simply, script is all manual and notebook/markdown are interactive scripts. The exact differece isn’t important right now, but some people have preferences for one of the other. This course will be using notebooks to easily send and access “assignments”. 3.2 Basic operations Here, we will be going over the very basic operations involved in coding. Most of coding relates to mathematics and logic! For example, below is a table that features basic math (addition, subject, etc.), how it is written in R (pay attention to the symbols used), and its result. Math R code Result \\(8 + 4\\) 8 + 4 12 \\(8 - 4\\) 8 - 4 4 \\(8 \\cdot4\\) 8 * 4 32 \\(8 / 4\\) 8 / 4 2 \\(8^4\\) 8 ^ 4 4096 This is an R Markdown Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. Try executing this chunk by clicking the Run button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing Ctrl+Shift+Enter. plot(cars) Add a new chunk by clicking the Insert Chunk button on the toolbar or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+I. When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the Preview button or press Ctrl+Shift+K to preview the HTML file). The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike Knit, Preview does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

You may want to try searching to find the page's new location, or use the table of contents to find the page you are looking for. "]]
