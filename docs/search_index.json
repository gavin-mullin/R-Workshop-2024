First, it should be noted that R and RStudio are actually two different things: R is a programming language RStudio is an application that provides a more user-friendly environment to use R But besides that, what is the importance of R? R is a powerful tool for statistics and data analysis, and is very attractive for both research and data science broadly. On top of this, it is accessible; R and RStudio are both free and open-source. This accessibility has resulted in a large community where learning and getting help is fast and easy. 2.2 Installing R and RStudio You will have to download both R and RStudio for this workshop (again, these are both FREE!!).
