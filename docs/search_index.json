Gavin and Yanzi are very excited to work with you all! Our goal is to teach you the basics and possibilities of RStudio, along with introducing you to resources and tools that will help you independently work with RStudio. 1.2 Important note Before we begin, we want to emphasize that learning R/RStudio (or any type of programming) is challenging and likely a novel topic for most of you. Therefore, it is completely normal to feel confused or overwhelmed at times. Please do not worry if you do not understand everything perfectly right away! Know that you will NOT be judged for asking questions or needing more time to learn certain topics. We are here to help! 1.3 Acknowledgements David Dalpiaz - Applied Statistics with R Luka Ignjatović - DataCamp "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What are R and RStudio? 2.2 Installing R and RStudio 2.3 The RStudio interface 2.4 Script vs. notebook vs. markdown?", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What are R and RStudio? First, it should be noted that R and RStudio are actually two different things: R is a programming language RStudio is an application that provides a more user-friendly environment to use R But besides that, what is the importance of R? R is a powerful tool for statistics and data analysis, and is very attractive for both research and data science broadly. On top of this, it is accessible; R and RStudio are both free and open-source. This accessibility has resulted in a large community where learning and getting help is fast and easy. 2.2 Installing R and RStudio You will have to download both R and RStudio for this workshop (again, these are both FREE!!). Here is a link to the general website (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), but I will also embed specific links below for a direct download: For Window users R for Windows RStudio for Windows For Mac users R for Mac RStudio for Mac 2.3 The RStudio interface Please watch this short 6 minute video to get started with RStudio. This video does include some simple coding as an example, but don’t worry if you don’t understand that for now. Focus just on the interface for the time being. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIrsOBy5k58&amp;t=242s Feel free to change the theme of your RStudio window (like changing it to dark mode) before we go further! You can access this by Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; Apperance, and then selecting a new theme. Highlight them all and see what you like, or feel free to change your font size or type. 2.4 Script vs. notebook vs. markdown? There are essentially three different file types to note when it comes to creating R code: script, notebook, and markdown. To put it simply, script is all manual and notebook/markdown are interactive scripts. The exact differece isn’t important right now, but some people have preferences for one or the other. This course will be using notebooks.

Most of coding relates to mathematics and logic! For example, below is a table that features basic math (addition, subject, etc.), how it is written in R (pay attention to the symbols used), and its result. Math R code Result \\(8 + 4\\) 8 + 4 12 \\(8 - 4\\) 8 - 4 4 \\(8 \\cdot4\\) 8 * 4 32 \\(8 / 4\\) 8 / 4 2 \\(8^4\\) 8 ^ 4 4096 3.2 Logical operators Operator Summary Example Result x &lt; y x less than y 3 &lt; 42 TRUE x &gt; y x greater than y 3 &gt; 42 FALSE x &lt;= y x less than or equal to y 3 &lt;= 42 TRUE x &gt;= y x greater than or equal to y 3 &gt;= 42 FALSE x == y xequal to y 3 == 42 FALSE x != y x not equal to y 3 != 42 TRUE !x not x !(3 &gt; 42) TRUE x | y x or y (3 &gt; 42) | TRUE TRUE x &amp; y x and y (3 &lt; 4) &amp; ( 42 &gt; 13) TRUE 3.3 Basic data types There are 5 data types to know of: Character Numeric Integer Logical Complex 3.4 Data structures Dimension Homogeneous Heterogeneous 1 Vector List 2 Matrix Data Frame 3+ Array "],["working-with-data.html", "Chapter 4 Working with data 4.1 Variable assignment 4.2 Summary statistics 4.3 Plotting", " Chapter 4 Working with data 4.1 Variable assignment 4.2 Summary statistics 4.3 Plotting "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
