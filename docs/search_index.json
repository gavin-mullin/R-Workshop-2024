Jennifer Coolidge in White Lotus 1.1 About this workshop Welcome to the Winter 2024 R Workshop with the Mende-Siedlecki Lab! Gavin and Yanzi are very excited to work with you all! Our goal is to teach you the basics and possibilities of RStudio, along with introducing you to resources and tools that will help you independently work with RStudio. 1.2 Important note Before we begin, we want to emphasize that learning R/RStudio (or any type of programming) is challenging and likely a novel topic for most of you. Therefore, it is completely normal to feel confused or overwhelmed at times. Please do not worry if you do not understand everything perfectly right away! Know that you will NOT be judged for asking questions or needing more time to learn certain topics. We are here to help! 1.3 Navigating this browser Think of this browser as a textbook. You can navigate the contents on the left (toggled by the ‘hamburger’ icon on the top left of your screen). Feel free to click on the ‘A’ at the top of the screen to change text size, or to change the browser to dark mode. 1.4 Acknowledgements David Dalpiaz - Applied Statistics with R Luka Ignjatović - DataCamp https://alexd106.github.io/intro2R/index.html "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What are R and RStudio? 2.2 Installing R and RStudio 2.3 The RStudio interface 2.4 R file types", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What are R and RStudio? First, it should be noted that R and RStudio are actually two different things: R is a programming language RStudio is an application that provides a more user-friendly environment to use R But besides that, what is the importance of R? R is a powerful tool for statistics and data analysis, and is very attractive for both research and data science broadly. On top of this, it is accessible; R and RStudio are both free and open-source. This accessibility has resulted in a large community where learning and getting help is fast and easy. Please watch this short 5 minute video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJc2J-qewiU 2.2 Installing R and RStudio You will have to download both R and RStudio for this workshop (again, these are both FREE!!). Here is a link to the general website (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), but I will also embed specific links below for a direct download: For Window users R for Windows RStudio for Windows For Mac users R for Mac RStudio for Mac 2.3 The RStudio interface Please watch this short 6 minute video to get started with RStudio. This video does include some simple coding as an example, but don’t worry if you don’t understand that for now. Focus just on the interface for the time being. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIrsOBy5k58&amp;t=242s Overview of the RStudio interface Feel free to change the theme of your RStudio environment (like changing it to a much better dark mode) before we go further! You can do this by navigating to Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; Appearance. Below is an image of what this window looks like. Here, you are about to change the editor theme, along with the font and font size if desired. Apperance editor window 2.4 R file types Navigating to File -&gt; New File, you can see there are a ton of different file options to choose from. For this course (and honestly even for our lab), you really only need to know about two of these options: R Script and R Notebook. These are documents where you are able to write and execute code. The difference between the two is formatting. R Script is essentially a blank word document whereas R Notebook allows more interactive elements. Choosing between the two is largely based on preference or sometimes the task. For this course, we will be using R Notebook as its interactive features will make “assignments” easier to navigate. "],["getting-started.html", "Chapter 3 Getting started 3.1 Basic operations 3.2 Variable assignment 3.3 Basic data types", " Chapter 3 Getting started 3.1 Basic operations Here, we will be going over the very basic operations involved in coding. Most of coding relates to mathematics and logic! For example, below is a table that features basic math (addition, subject, etc.), how it is written in R (pay attention to the symbols used), and its result. Math R code Result \\(8 + 4\\) 8 + 4 12 \\(8 - 4\\) 8 - 4 4 \\(8 \\cdot4\\) 8 * 4 32 \\(8 / 4\\) 8 / 4 2 \\(8^4\\) 8 ^ 4 4096 \\(\\sqrt{100}\\) sqrt(100) 10 3.2 Variable assignment A variable is a basic concept in programming: it allows you to store a value or an object in R. You can then call this variable’s name to easily access this value or object since it is already stored into R’s memory. For instance, let’s assign the variable X to a value of 1, and Y to a value of 2. # Assigning a value of 1 to &#39;X&#39; X &lt;- 1 # Assigning a value of 2 to &#39;Y&#39; Y &lt;- 2 Notice the use of &lt;-. You can think of this as an equal sign (=). This is the symbol combination used to assign a value to a variable. Logically, know that the value points to the variables saying “hey, this value is what this varaible should be”. 3.3 Basic data types There are 5 data types to know of: Character: Letters and words. For instance, in research, this could be seen in data as categorical variables like gender identity: man. Logical: These result in two possible values: TRUE or FALSE (or NA…). Numeric: This is typically the default when dealing with numbers. These include numbers with decimal points. 1, 1.5, 10.2. Integer: These are WHOLE numbers without decimals 1 5 10. Complex: This is something we will just gloss over- in sum, an equation with an imaginary number 2 + 5i.

You likely are familiar with these concepts through greater than and less than inequalities! Here is a table that spells out many of the operations, how it would be coded in R, and the output R gives. Notice the logic results in “TRUE” or “FALSE”. This concept might be familiar if you have used Excel. Operator Summary Example Result x &lt; y x less than y 3 &lt; 42 TRUE x &gt; y x greater than y 3 &gt; 42 FALSE x &lt;= y x less than or equal to y 3 &lt;= 42 TRUE x &gt;= y x greater than or equal to y 3 &gt;= 42 FALSE x == y xequal to y 3 == 42 FALSE x != y x not equal to y 3 != 42 TRUE !x not x !(3 &gt; 42) TRUE x | y x or y (3 &gt; 42) | TRUE TRUE x &amp; y x and y (3 &lt; 4) &amp; ( 42 &gt; 13) TRUE 4.3 Data structures Dimension Homogeneous Heterogeneous 1 Vector List 2 Matrix Data Frame 3+ Array 4.4 Summary statistics 4.5 Plotting "],["data-wrangling.html", "Chapter 5 Data wrangling 5.1 Tidying data 5.2 Pipes", " Chapter 5 Data wrangling 5.1 Tidying data 5.2 Pipes "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
